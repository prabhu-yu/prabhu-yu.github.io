When nothing is better than something !!!
Generally, we get encrypted pdf files from Banks, Govt Office etc.
The keys are so well defined, it is very easy to crack them.
If the file is not encrypted at the very first place, the consumers would 
take the job of controlleing them. Since things are encrypted, ordinary people
tend to think that, files are secure as long as they keep the password secure.

Here, a small python script, how to extract a password from an encrypted file.
Typically, files are encrypted with mix of Date of birth, or customer number etc.

Here, I created a dummy encrypted file, which encrypted with DOB in DDMMYYYY format.
We just dont know what it is.

Since it is date of birth, it can not be more than current date, and can not be less than 70-80 years.
based ion this I  reduce probably key list.
Hence I wrote this program.
We can use simple tricks to reduce the probable key and break the security.

So, I believe, it is better to give no security than poor security. Let people own it in such cases.!
